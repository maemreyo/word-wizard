## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public issue

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Report privately

Send an email to [security@yourproject.com] with the following information:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### 3. Response timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix timeline**: Depends on severity (see below)

## Severity Levels

### Critical (Fix within 24-48 hours)
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Data exfiltration vulnerabilities

### High (Fix within 1 week)
- Privilege escalation
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- SQL injection

### Medium (Fix within 2 weeks)
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- CSRF vulnerabilities

### Low (Fix within 1 month)
- Minor information leaks
- Non-exploitable bugs

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep the extension updated** to the latest version
2. **Review permissions** before installing
3. **Report suspicious behavior** immediately
4. **Use strong API keys** and rotate them regularly

### For Developers

1. **Input validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **Content Security Policy**: Implement strict CSP headers
3. **Secure storage**: Never store sensitive data in plain text
4. **API security**: Use HTTPS and proper authentication
5. **Permission principle**: Request minimal necessary permissions

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

- **Input sanitization** for all user inputs
- **Rate limiting** to prevent API abuse
- **Secure storage** with encryption for sensitive data
- **Content Security Policy** implementation
- **Permission validation** before API calls

### Security Headers

```javascript
// Content Security Policy
"content_security_policy": {
  "extension_pages": "script-src 'self'; object-src 'self'"
}
```

### Secure Coding Practices

```typescript
// Input validation example
import { z } from 'zod'

const userInputSchema = z.object({
  text: z.string().min(1).max(10000),
  options: z.object({
    sanitize: z.boolean().default(true)
  }).optional()
})

function validateInput(input: unknown) {
  return userInputSchema.parse(input)
}
```

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Report received**: We acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We investigate and validate the report
3. **Fix development**: We develop and test a fix
4. **Release**: We release the fix in a new version
5. **Public disclosure**: We publicly disclose after fix is released

### Recognition

We maintain a security hall of fame for researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:

- [Researcher Name] - [Vulnerability Type] - [Date]

## Security Updates

### Automatic Updates

The extension supports automatic updates through the Chrome Web Store. Critical security updates are pushed immediately.

### Manual Updates

For development versions:

```bash
# Check for updates
npm run security:audit
